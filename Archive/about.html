            I am a computer science major at North Carolina State University with a focus on game
            development. I have a passion for video games and have been playing all kinds of games
            my entire life. I love to create things, and once I start working on a project, it
            is near impossible to get me to stop until I have accomplished what I set out to do.
            I like Game Jams as they test my creativity and abilities.

            I started programming because I wanted to learn how to create mods for Minecraft. Since
            then my love for coding has gone beyong just modding, and has turned into a passion for
            creating games! I am a member of the NCSU Video Game Development Club which has greatly helped
            me become a better developer.
        </p>

            I am currently in my Junior year at NCSU. I am working on a few projects with the VGDC,
            and some on my own. I am looking for an internship for the summer of 2024.
